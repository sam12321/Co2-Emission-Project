# Co2-Emission-Project
in this project we analyse the emission of co2 and it's relation with different features of car using a linear regression model.
# Dataset
the dataset contains 14 columns and 1067 rows.It contains data about the car such as VEHICLECLASS	ENGINESIZE	CYLINDERS	TRANSMISSION	FUELTYPE	FUELCONSUMPTION_CITY etc.
# Goal
the main goal of this project is to analyze the given dataset and the correlation between it's data and then create a well designed and 
efficient linear regression model,so that it is able to accurately predict the amount of co2 emission based on some given features
